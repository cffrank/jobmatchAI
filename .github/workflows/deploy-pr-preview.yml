            const body = `## 🚀 PR Preview Environment Ready

**Backend URL:** ${previewUrl}

**Environment Name:** \`${envName}\`

**Health Status:** ${healthBadge} ${healthNote}

### How to Test
1. Use the backend URL above for API testing
2. Update frontend \`VITE_API_URL\` to point to this preview
3. Run integration tests against the preview environment

### Testing the Preview
- Health endpoint: \`${previewUrl}/health\`
- API documentation: \`${previewUrl}/api/docs\` (if available)
- All backend features are available in this preview

### Important Notes
- ✓ This environment auto-deletes when PR closes
- ✓ Each new commit creates a fresh deployment
- ✓ Suitable for integration & E2E testing
- ⚠️ Do not rely on data persistence across deployments

### Configuration
- Environment: \`${envName}\`
- Inherited from: Production environment variables
- Auto-cleanup: Enabled (deletes on PR close)

**Railway Dashboard:** https://railway.app/project

See [\`docs/PHASE2-PR-ENVIRONMENTS.md\`](../docs/PHASE2-PR-ENVIRONMENTS.md) for more details on PR preview environments.`;
